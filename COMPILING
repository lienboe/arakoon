We use opam

Some of the packages we use are not in the main opam repository (yet). So it's easiest if you add our devel repo:

opam remote --kind git add devel git://github.com/Incubaid/opam-repository-devel.git

Packages we use:

ocamlfind.1.3.3
snappy.0.1.0
camlbz2.0.6.0
ssl
lwt with SSL support
camltc
quickcheck
leveldb

When it's been a while you might want to run `opam update` first to get the latest versions.


COMPILING:

make
(you can inspect the makefile for more fine grained targets)
(if you get errors and you've built arakoon before you could try a `make clean` first)

RUNNING THE TESTS:

	./arakoon.native --run-all-tests

COVERAGE:
Bisect needs to be installed. (get it from http://bisect.x9c.fr/)

	ocamlbuild -tag use_bisect -tag use_macro arakoon.d.byte
	./report.sh

DEBIAN packages:
	fakeroot debian/rules clean
	fakeroot debian/rules build
	fakeroot debian/rules binary

Python egg:
	python setup.py bdist_egg



have fun,

The arakoon team
